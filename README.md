Movie Genre Classification

Objective: Develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify movies into different genres based on their IMDb data, such as plot summaries, cast members, ratings, etc.

Steps to Implement:

Data Collection:

Obtain IMDb datasets containing information about movies, including plot summaries, genres, cast members, ratings, release dates, etc. IMDb provides datasets that can be downloaded and used for non-commercial purposes.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the IMDb data, including handling missing values, tokenizing text data (e.g., plot summaries), encoding categorical features (e.g., genres), and creating train/test splits.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the data, such as word embeddings for plot summaries using techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe, one-hot encoding for genres, and numerical features like ratings.
Model Architecture:

Design a deep learning model using TensorFlow for movie genre classification. You can use techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or a combination of both (e.g., CNN-RNN models) to process text and other features.
Training and Evaluation:

Train the deep learning model using the preprocessed IMDb data. Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) to assess the model's performance on the test dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. This may involve adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, optimizer settings, and model architecture parameters.
Model Deployment (Optional):

Optionally, deploy the trained model as a web service or API using frameworks like TensorFlow Serving or Flask. Users can input movie details, and the model predicts the genres of the movie.
Testing and Validation:

Validate the model's predictions by comparing them with actual IMDb genre labels. Analyze the model's strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
