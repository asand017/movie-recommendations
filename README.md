### Project: Movie Recommendation System

#### Project Overview
Develop a full-stack movie recommendation system using Python for the backend, Docker for containerization, and movie-related datasets. The system will provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history. This project will showcase your skills in data processing, machine learning, and full-stack development, which are crucial for an AI Full Stack Engineer role.

#### Project Specifications

1. **Project Setup and Environment**
   - Use Docker to create isolated development and production environments.
   - Create Docker images for the backend application and any necessary services (e.g., database, front-end).
   - Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.

2. **Backend Development (Python)**
   - Use Flask or Django to create a RESTful API.
   - Implement endpoints for user authentication, movie search, user preferences, and recommendations.
   - Use a PostgreSQL database to store user data, movie information, and user preferences.
   - Use SQLAlchemy (with Flask) or Django ORM for database interactions.

3. **Data Processing and Machine Learning**
   - Obtain and preprocess a movie dataset (e.g., [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)).
   - Clean and transform the data to be used in machine learning models.
   - Implement a collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation algorithm.
   - Use libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow or PyTorch for data processing and model building.

4. **Frontend Development**
   - Create a simple front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React.js or Angular can be used for more advanced UIs).
   - Allow users to search for movies, view recommendations, and provide ratings or feedback.
   - Integrate the front-end with the backend API to fetch and display data.

5. **Containerization and Deployment**
   - Write Dockerfiles for the backend and front-end applications.
   - Use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
   - Deploy the application to a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) using Docker.
   - Ensure the system is scalable and can handle multiple user requests efficiently.

6. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Write unit and integration tests for the backend API.
   - Use tools like pytest for Python testing and Selenium for end-to-end testing of the front-end.
   - Document the project setup, API endpoints, and usage instructions in a README file.

#### Project Steps

1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose.
   - Create a Dockerfile for the backend (Python/Flask or Django).
   - Create a Dockerfile for the front-end (React.js or Angular).

2. **Develop the Backend**
   - Set up a Flask or Django project.
   - Create models for users, movies, and ratings using SQLAlchemy or Django ORM.
   - Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT).
   - Create API endpoints for movie search, recommendations, and user preferences.

3. **Data Processing and Model Training**
   - Download and preprocess the movie dataset.
   - Implement and train a recommendation algorithm.
   - Save the trained model for inference.

4. **Develop the Frontend**
   - Set up a React.js or Angular project.
   - Create components for movie search, recommendation display, and user ratings.
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend API.

5. **Containerize and Deploy**
   - Write Dockerfiles for the backend and front-end.
   - Use Docker Compose to define services and networks.
   - Deploy the application to a cloud provider.

6. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Write and run tests for the backend and frontend.
   - Document the entire project, including setup instructions and API documentation.
